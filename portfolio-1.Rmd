This is series of code to analyze my thesis data using repeated measure ANOVAs and the afex package.

```{r load-data}
library(readxl)
Young <- read_excel("Young.xlsx")

str(Young)
```


```{r change-to-factor}
Young$PID<-as.factor(Young$PID)

```

```{r}
Young$Block_type <- factor(Young$Block_type,
                               levels = c(1,2),
                               labels = c("Mostly_Hold_Block", "Mostly_Shift_Block")) 

#converts 1's and 2's in the data file to correspond to factor labels of the block type variable of study method.

Young$Shift_type <-factor(Young$Shift_type,
                                  levels = c(1,2),
                                  labels = c("Hold_Cue", "Shift_Cue")) 

#converts 1's and 2's in the data file to correspond to factor labels of the cue type variable of time.
