## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

This is portfolio piece I will use to analyze some of my thesis data using repeated measure ANOVAs. I used the afex package for my ANOVA because it uses the same sum of squares as SPSS and was recommended by Anthony. I also used a tutorial, "Chapter21: ANOVA (afex): Within Subjects and Mixed Designs" by Matthew McCurdy to guide me.

```{r load-data}
library(readxl)
library(psych)
library(tidyverse)
library(afex)
library(emmeans)
Old <- read_excel("Old.xlsx")

str(Old)
```


```{r change-to-factor}
Old$PID<-as.factor(Old$PID)

```

```{r assign-labels}
Old$Block_type <- factor(Old$Block_type,
                               levels = c(1,2),
                               labels = c("Mostly_Hold_Block", "Mostly_Shift_Block")) 

#converts 1's and 2's in the data file to correspond to factor labels of the block type variable of study method.

Old$Shift_type <-factor(Old$Shift_type,
                                  levels = c(1,2),
                                  labels = c("Hold_Cue", "Shift_Cue")) 

#converts 1's and 2's in the data file to correspond to factor labels of the cue type variable of time.
```

```{r check-labels}
head(Old, n=5)
```

```{r descriptives}
#use psych package to call for descriptives of your dataset and place into an object.

Old.Table<-describe(Old)

Old.Table #call the object to see the means table
```


```{r graphing}

ggplot(Old, mapping = aes(x = Shift_type, y = RT)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary")+
  facet_grid(.~Block_type)+
  labs(title = "Response Times on an Attention Shifting Paradigm in Older Adults" , x = "Cue Type")

```

```{r ANOVA-with-generalized-eta-squared}


Old.aov.1 <- aov_car(RT ~ Block_type*Shift_type+ Error(PID/Block_type*Shift_type), data=Old)

Old.aov.1 #call object to see ANOVA table


```
I put both eta squared options because I don't know which is better currently.
```{r ANOVA-with_partial-eta-squared}

Old.aov.2 <- aov_car(RT ~ Block_type*Shift_type+ Error(PID/Block_type*Shift_type), data=Old,
                     anova_table = list(es = "pes"))

Old.aov.2 #call object to see ANOVA table
```

```{r main-effect-cue}
Shift_type_follow_up<-emmeans(Old.aov.1, ~Shift_type)

Shift_type_follow_up
```


```{r interaction}
Old_Interaction <- emmeans(Old.aov.1, ~ Shift_type|Block_type)
Old_Interaction
#compare means, bonferroni corrected
pairs(Old_Interaction, adjust = "bon")
```
